# Star Wars Bestiary API

This is just a simple project I made to learn the basic concepts of ASP.NET and how I can interact with a Azure SQL Database.

## Resources

I used the following resources to complete this project:
- [Tutorial: Create a web API with ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=visual-studio-code)
- [Connect to and query Azure SQL Database using .NET and Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/azure-sql-dotnet-entity-framework-core-quickstart?view=azuresql&tabs=dotnet-cli%2Cservice-connector%2Cportal)

## How To Use

To interact with this API you can start with the endpoint (https://star-wars-bestiary-api.azurewebsites.net/api/Creatures). By exploring the Controller file in this project, you can see the other Get requests that are available.
